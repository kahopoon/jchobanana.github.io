<em>Development Studies & Political Science, Class of 2015</em>
<p>I'm a 22-year old senior who's very lost in life, but I guess that's not unusual. I do a little bit of graphic design with my extremely limited knowledge in Photoshop and Illstrator, and just decided to stay an extra sememster to get a Fine Arts Minor for fun.  I used to do some programming back in high school, since I was very into Robotics with three of my best friends back then. Sadly, after four years of not having STEM in my life, that part of my brain had pretty much stop functioning. I know it sounds really cliche, but I chose my majors because I really want to help making the world a better place; especially for people who have been suffering with social injustice. Although I really don't enjoy messing with politics in general, but I believe bad politics is the root of all the major problems, and hopefully someday I will find a formula that can solve problems that I care the most about in a much efficient way than it is today. Oh, I'm from Taiwan btw, yay.</p>
